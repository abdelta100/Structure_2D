Worked on why solver distributes reaction from a single point load applied vertically on a node, between the reaction
immediately in line, and one further away. Explored matrix instability, bit precision etc. No significant progress,
except false leads.

Figured out original solver was probably correct in distributing reaction. Non distribution required assuming axial
stiffnesses were infinite and no axial displacement would occur. However solver factors axial stiffness which causes
axial displacement, which creates moment, which transfers load to other side and then to the support.
